# IWXXM
IWXXM (the ICAO Meteorological Information Exchange Model) is a data format for reporting aviation weather information
in XML/GML, and is specified in both XML Schema and Schematron.

Testbed One is the place to try out new stuffs for IWXXM which could be too crazy to discuss and follow up in the official sites.  Matured items will be moved back to the respective repositories as applicable.
